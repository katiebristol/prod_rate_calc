# Production Rate Calculator

**This algorithm is currently in development.**
It is not usable in its current state. 

## Purpose

This algorithm is being developed to calculate the production rate
of cosmogenic nuclides throughout time. 

## How to use

Instructions on use will go here.
We could do both the script and a nb and then have a link to launch the nb via binder or colab here. That would cut down on time having to worry about a GUI. See README here for example https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/try-gmt 

## Inputs

## References and Notes

limitations, accompanying pubs or posters or whatever.
